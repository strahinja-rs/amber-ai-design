# Amber Brand Guidelines

## Brand Essence

**Tagline:** Never lose what matters.

**Brand Promise:** Amber gives you peace of mind in conversations that matter. You can be fully present — eye contact, emotional connection, undivided attention — because Amber remembers for you.

**Core Truth:** The warmth isn't nostalgia. It's security.

## Logo

### Primary Mark

The Amber logo combines a pendant silhouette with an organic, glowing amber drop shape. It should feel like jewelry, not technology.

#### Design Principles
- Organic, not geometric
- Warm glow emanating from center
- Translucent quality suggested through gradients
- Pendant/drop shape references both jewelry and fossilized amber
- No circuits, no neural networks, no AI clichés

#### Logo Variations
1. **Full Logo:** Wordmark + Symbol
2. **Symbol Only:** For small applications, app icons
3. **Wordmark Only:** For text-heavy contexts

#### Clear Space
Minimum clear space = height of the "A" in wordmark

#### Minimum Size
- Digital: 24px height minimum
- Print: 10mm height minimum

### Logo Don'ts
- Don't rotate or skew
- Don't add drop shadows
- Don't change colors outside approved palette
- Don't add outlines or strokes
- Don't place on busy backgrounds without treatment

## Motion
