## Overview

Three campaign directions targeting different audiences. Each brief is ready for image generation with Nano Banana or similar tools.

## Campaign 1: Medical / Caregivers

**Message:** "Never forget what the doctor said."

### Hero Image (16:9)

**Scene:** Warm, intimate medical consultation moment. A patient (50s-60s woman) sits across from a doctor in a well-lit, modern office. The lighting is warm and golden, not clinical fluorescent. The Amber pendant is visible but subtle—glowing softly against her sweater.

**Composition:**
- Patient in foreground, slight profile view, looking at doctor with engaged expression
- Doctor partially visible, gesturing while explaining
- Depth of field: patient sharp, background softly blurred
- Window with warm natural light in background

**Mood:** Calm, reassuring, present. The patient looks focused and at ease, not anxious.

**Color direction:**
- Warm amber/golden tones throughout
- Avoid clinical blues and greens
- Soft cream and warm brown accents
- Rich shadows, not flat lighting

**Text overlay:** "Never forget what the doctor said."
**Subtext:** "Amber preserves every word so you can be fully present."

**Nano Banana prompt:**
```

```

### Social Square (1:1)

## Campaign 2: Professional

**Message:** "Conversations that matter happen off the record."

### Hero Image (16:9)

**Composition:**
- Two people mid-conversation, natural body language
- Evening/ambient lighting with warm tones
- Background suggests conference setting (blurred other attendees, warm lights)
- Badge-style Amber visible on one person's jacket

**Mood:** Confident, connected, valuable moment being captured.

**Color direction:**
- Evening amber tones
- Rich warm blacks and browns
- Hints of gold from ambient lighting
- Professional but warm

**Text overlay:** "Conversations that matter happen off the record."
**Subtext:** "Meeting software captures scheduled calls. Amber captures the rest."

**Nano Banana prompt:**
```

```

### Social Square (1:1)

**Nano Banana prompt:**
```

```

### LinkedIn Banner (1200x627)

**Scene:** Silhouette of two professionals walking and talking in a hallway, backlit by golden light from windows. Suggests the "hallway conversation" that meetings can't capture.

**Nano Banana prompt:**
```

## Campaign 3: Universal / Emotional

**Message:** "Never lose what matters."

### Hero Image (16:9)

**Composition:**
- Two people in genuine connection
- Warm, intimate setting (living room, café, porch)
- Golden hour lighting
- Pendant visible but not prominent—maybe catching light

**Mood:** Meaningful, warm, human. The technology disappears into the moment.

**Color direction:**
- Rich amber and honey tones
- Warm wood textures
- Soft cream highlights
- Deep, warm shadows

**Text overlay:** "Never lose what matters."

```
