## The Challenge

Design a complete product experience for a fictional AI wearable device.

### AI Pendant

Your fictional product to design

A wearable AI device worn around the neck or as a badge. It has a camera and microphone that captures your day, transcribes conversations, remembers faces and names, and helps you never forget a moment. Think of it as an AI assistant that's always with you, always watching, always listening, always helping.

#### Camera

Always-on camera that captures moments

#### Audio

Records and transcribes conversations

#### Companion App

Syncs with your phone

#### Connectivity

Works with earbuds and other devices

#### All-Day Battery

Lasts through your entire day

#### AI Processing

On-device AI for real-time insights

### The Product Brief

You are a designer hired by a startup to launch their new AI Pendant. They've built the hardware and the AI, but they need you to create the entire brand and digital experience. You have one afternoon. Go.

## What You'll Deliver

Here's what you need to present at the end of the hackathon.

### Required DeliverablesMust have

#### Brand Identity

20%

Name, logo, color palette, typography, brand guidelines. Make it memorable.

#### Marketing Website

30%

At least 3 landing pages for different target audiences. Think about who buys this.

#### Product Interface

30%

Either a web dashboard or companion mobile app. Show us what happens after purchase.

#### Campaign Visuals

20%

Ad creatives for your target segments. How do you sell this thing?

### Bonus PointsOptional

#### Mobile Companion App

If you did a dashboard, also do the app (or vice versa)

#### Physical Product Render

What does the actual pendant look like? Get creative.

### Important: Show Your Work

You must be able to show your prompt history. We're not just judging the final output - we want to see how you got there. The prompts are part of the story. Your thinking, your iterations, your creative process with AI. That's what makes this interesting.

## You Own Everything You Create

The AI Pendant is a fictional product created solely for this hackathon challenge. All work you produce during the event belongs entirely to you.

### 100% Your IP

Every brand, design, mockup, and creative asset you make is yours. We claim no ownership over your work.

### Use It Anywhere

Add it to your portfolio. Show it to clients. Use it to land your next job. It's yours to do with as you please.

### No Strings Attached

No licensing agreements. No usage restrictions. No hidden clauses. What you create here leaves with you.

This hackathon is about learning, experimenting, and pushing your creative boundaries with AI tools. The fictional product brief exists purely to give you a focused challenge - not to extract value from your talent.

## The Rules

Simple constraints that make this interesting.

### Allowed

- V0.dev - for UI generation
- Claude / ChatGPT - for any AI assistance
- Midjourney / DALL-E / Ideogram - for image generation
- Cursor / Bolt / Lovable - AI-first editors are OK
- Hand sketches - scan or photo them, feed to AI
- Any other AI tools you discover

### Not Allowed

- Figma / Sketch / Adobe XD
- VS Code / WebStorm / traditional code editors
- Photoshop / Illustrator manually
- Templates or pre-made assets
- Work you did before the hackathon

### The Spirit of the Rule

The goal is simple: we want to see what's possible when AI is your primary design tool. If you're not sure whether something is allowed, ask yourself: "Am I using this to bypass the AI constraint?" If yes, don't use it.

Edge cases will be judged by the organizers. When in doubt, ask us before the event.

## How We'll Judge

In order of importance - what the judges will be looking for.

### Primary Criteria

1

### AI Product Design

Critical

How do you use this magical new technology to create a magical new experience that's also realistic? The pendant can't shoot lasers. Work within the hardware constraints below and show us something we haven't seen before.

2

### Business Thinking

Critical

Who buys this thing? How do you position it to them? We want to see real audience segmentation and marketing that actually speaks to those people. Show us you understand the market.

3

### Looks Great, Not Slop

Critical

Everything from the product renders to the brand to the interface should look polished and intentional. Generic AI aesthetics won't cut it. We can tell when you didn't refine the output.

### Hardware Constraints

White-label specs, Shenzhen Q1 2026

This is what you're working with. Design within these real-world limitations.

Processor Qualcomm QCS8550 (8-core, 4nm)

Flagship wearable chip with dedicated NPU. Runs on-device ML, voice processing, and complex animations. No cloud needed for basic AI tasks.

RAM 2GB LPDDR5

Enough for smooth multitasking and keeping apps in memory. Can handle real-time video processing buffers.

Storage 64GB NVMe

Store weeks of audio/video locally. Room for apps, cached AI models, and offline data.

Camera 12MP ultra-wide, f/1.8, OIS, 4K30 video

Can capture faces clearly across a room. Good low-light. Video is smooth enough for real content.

Audio 3-mic array, spatial audio, bone conduction

Isolates your voice in noisy environments. Can whisper commands. Records conversations clearly.

Connectivity Bluetooth 5.3 LE, WiFi 6E, NFC

Instant pairing with your smartphone and wireless earbuds. Seamless handoff between devices. Tap-to-pair with NFC.

Battery 580mAh (18hr typical, 3hr fast charge)

Full day with heavy use. Quick top-up over lunch gets you through evening.

### Red Flags (Things That Will Hurt Your Score)

- \- Generic tech startup aesthetic (blue gradients, generic illustrations)
- \- Copy that sounds like ChatGPT wrote it without editing
- \- Inconsistent brand across deliverables
- \- No consideration for target audience

## What's In It For You?

Beyond the competition itself.

### Compete With The Best

You'll be in a room with some of the most forward-thinking designers in Serbia. The kind who already see where this is going.

### Learn New Techniques

Watch how others prompt. See their workflows. Steal their best ideas. That's the point.

### Push Your Limits

You'll be forced to move faster than you thought possible. Constraints breed creativity.

### Present Your Work

Practice pitching your design decisions. Get feedback from judges and peers. Get better at selling your ideas.

### Meet People

Network with designers, entrepreneurs, and tech people who care about the future of AI and design.

### Bragging Rights

Winners will be featured in our media coverage. Your work will be seen by thousands.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Everything you need to know before applying.

### Can I participate from outside Serbia?

Yes! This is a regional hackathon open to participants from across the Balkans and beyond. While the event takes place in person in Novi Sad, Serbia, we welcome applications from Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Slovenia, and any other country. If you can make it to Novi Sad on February 3rd, you're welcome to apply.

### Can I really not use Figma at all?

Correct. No Figma, no Sketch, no traditional design tools. The point is to see what's possible when AI is your only design tool. You can use V0, Claude, ChatGPT, Midjourney, and similar AI tools. Hand sketches that you then feed to AI are fine too.

### What about code editors?

Also no. If you're using AI tools that generate code (like V0), that's fine - but you shouldn't be opening VS Code to manually edit things. The constraint is intentional.

### Can I use my own AI subscriptions?

Yes. Bring your own tools and subscriptions. If you've been paying for Claude Pro or ChatGPT Plus, use them. The hackathon is about skill, not who has access to what.

### Can I participate alone or do I need a team?

Both are fine. You can compete solo or form a team of up to 4 people. Solo participants often do surprisingly well since there's less coordination overhead. Teams can divide and conquer different deliverables.

### Do I need prior AI experience?

You should already be using AI tools in your workflow. This isn't an introductory workshop - it's a competition for people who already know what they're doing and want to push further.

### What if I finish early?

Then either make it better or help others. If someone finishes in 30 minutes with something amazing, more power to them. But that's unlikely.

### Who owns the intellectual property?

You do. 100%. We will not use any participant's work for any purpose. This is your portfolio piece.

### Why do I have to show my prompt history?

Because the process is part of what we're evaluating. We want to see how you think, how you iterate, and how sophisticated your AI usage is. Also, it prevents cheating.

### Is this free?

Yes, participation is free. But spots are limited and we'll select participants based on applications.

### Who's behind this event?

This hackathon is organized by Startit, Serbia's leading tech community organization. Startit has been supporting the local tech ecosystem for over a decade through events, education, and community building.
