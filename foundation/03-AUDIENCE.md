# Audience

## Primary Audience: Medical/Caregivers

### The Problem

**40-80% of medical information is forgotten immediately** after a consultation.

Patients leave doctor's appointments anxious, overwhelmed, and unable to recall critical instructions about medication, treatment, or diagnosis. By the time they reach the parking lot, half of what was said is already gone.

### Who They Are

- Patients navigating health situations (diagnosis, treatment, chronic conditions)
- Family caregivers (53M in the US alone) managing loved ones' health
- Adult children attending appointments with aging parents
- Anyone facing medical complexity

### Their Current Alternatives

| Alternative | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| Taking notes | Disrupts the conversation. Can't make eye contact. Miss emotional cues. |
| Asking to record on phone | Awkward to pull out. Feels like you don't trust the doctor. |
| Bringing someone to listen | Not always possible. They forget too. |
| Asking the doctor to repeat | Embarrassing. Rushed appointments don't allow it. |
| Relying on memory | 40-80% forgotten. Stress impairs encoding further. |

### Why Amber Fits

- Wearing a pendant is natural, non-disruptive
- Warm glow signals it's active (transparent, not sneaky)
- Patient can be fully present — eye contact, emotional connection
- Everything preserved for later review
- HIPAA doesn't restrict patient recording (common misconception)
- 39 states are one-party consent

### Key Insight

> The warmth of Amber isn't about nostalgia — it's about comfort in anxious situations. A security blanket for medical conversations.

## Secondary Audience: Professionals

### The Problem

The conversations that matter most happen **off the record** — hallway discussions, networking dinners, client coffee chats, trade show introductions.

Meeting transcription software captures scheduled calls. Nothing captures the rest.

### Who They Are

- Salespeople maintaining client relationships
- Executives in negotiations
- Consultants with multiple clients
- Networkers at conferences and events
- Anyone whose job depends on remembering context

### Their Current Alternatives

| Alternative | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| CRM systems | Require manual entry. Who does that after a dinner? |
| Meeting transcription | Only scheduled calls. Misses informal conversations. |
| Business card apps | No context. Just contact info. |
| Memory | Names fade. Context vanishes. "Wait, what did we agree on?" |

### Why Amber Fits

- Badge form factor works in professional settings
- Captures the informal conversations software misses
- Face recognition helps with "Who was that person?"
- Searchable: "What did the client say about the timeline?"

### Key Insight

> Professionals already use AI tools (75%). Amber captures what their existing tools can't — the conversations that happen outside the calendar.

## Tertiary Audience: Students & Learners

### The Problem

**You can't take notes and truly listen at the same time.**

Students spend lectures frantically transcribing, so focused on capturing words that they miss understanding concepts. Later, their notes don't make sense because they weren't actually processing the information.

10-20% of lecture content is typically retained without review. 50% of students report anxiety about missing important information.

### Who They Are

- University/college students in demanding programs
- Graduate students in thesis/research phases
- Language learners practicing with native speakers
- Lifelong learners in courses and workshops
- Students with learning differences who benefit from review

### Their Current Alternatives

| Alternative | Why It Fails |
|-------------|--------------|
| Taking notes | Can't write and understand simultaneously. Miss the explanation while capturing words. |
| Lecture recordings | Not all lectures are recorded. Can't search. Hours of video to scrub through. |
| Recording on phone | Awkward to set up. Low quality audio. Feels performative. |
| Asking classmates | They missed things too. Second-hand information. |
| Reading slides later | Slides don't contain the explanations. The value is in the spoken word. |

### Why Amber Fits

- Pendant is unobtrusive in academic settings
- Focus on understanding, not transcription
- Search across all lectures: "What did Professor Martinez say about thermodynamics?"
- Review office hours guidance before meetings
- Preserve study group breakthroughs

### Key Insight

> The anxiety of "Am I getting this down?" blocks actual learning. Amber removes that anxiety so students can be present, ask questions, and engage.

## Quaternary Audience: Personal High-Stakes Conversations

### The Problem

Important conversations in relationships, life decisions, and personal matters fade just like any other.

### Who They Are

- People in significant life discussions (relationship, family, decisions)
- Anyone who's thought "I wish I remembered exactly what we agreed on"
- Those who value preserving voices of loved ones

### Why Amber Fits

- Pendant feels appropriate for personal contexts
- Less about productivity, more about preservation
- Universal appeal: "Never lose what matters"
