## Personality Traits

1. **Warm** — Not cold tech. Golden, honey tones. A comfort object.
2. **Quiet** — No personality, no voice, no opinions. It never reaches out.
3. **Honest** — Doesn't disguise what it is. A device that preserves what was said.
4. **Secure** — Wearing it means peace of mind. You won't forget.
5. **Timeless** — Like amber itself. Not trendy, not dated.

## Visual Direction

### Color Palette
| Role | Color | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Primary | Amber/Golden | #D4A253 — the Trust Light glow, active states, interactive elements |
| Secondary | Deep Warm Brown | #4A3728 — grounding, natural |
| Accent | Soft Cream | #F5EDE0 — device body color, backgrounds, surfaces |
| Background | Rich Black | #1A1614 — not pure black, warm undertone |

### Device-to-Brand Relationship
- **Device at rest:** Quiet cream/champagne body (closer to #F5EDE0)
- **Device active:** Warm amber edge glow (#D4A253)
- **Brand meaning:** The amber color IS the Trust Light. The brand appears when Amber is listening.
- **Visual principle:** Cream = quiet presence. Amber = active moment.

### Typography Direction
- Display: Something with character. Not geometric. Could be serif or humanist sans.
- Body: Readable, warm, not cold/technical.
- Avoid: Inter, Roboto, system fonts, anything generic tech.

### Visual Metaphors
- Warmth as security (comfort object)
- Glowing from within (active, present)
- Translucent layers (honesty, nothing hidden)
- Jewelry, not gadget
- Natural materials (ceramic, stone, warmth)

### Industrial Design References
- **Naoto Fukasawa** — "Without Thought" philosophy, objects that dissolve into behavior
- **Jasper Morrison** — "Super Normal" aesthetic, quiet sophistication
- **Oura Ring** — Jewelry-first wearable, kaolin-inspired ceramic
- **Bellabeat Leaf** — Haptic-only, zero visible tech indicators

### Shape Language
- Asymmetric pebble form (not perfect circle)
- C2 curvature continuity (no visible transition points)
- River stone / worry stone / seed references
- Gently domed front, slight concavity on back
- "Discovered" asymmetry — organic, not manufactured

### Photography/Imagery
- Warm light, golden hour
- Intimate conversations (not staged tech shots)
- The pendant as subtle presence, not hero
- Real people in real moments
- Medical: comfort in clinical settings
- Professional: hallway conversations, networking

**Device Photography:**
- Show device at rest: quiet cream ceramic, organic pebble form, woven cord
- Show device active: warm amber edge glow emanating from within
- The glow is the brand moment — cream body disappears, amber speaks
- Macro shots: satin glazed texture, C2 curvature, material warmth
