# Positioning

## Category

**Personal audio preservation device**

Not:
- AI assistant
- Meeting recorder (that's Plaud)
- Lifelogging camera
- Smartphone replacement

## Core Positioning Statement

> For people in conversations that matter — medical, professional, personal — who can't afford to forget what was said, **Amber** is the wearable that preserves everything so you can be fully present, because your files stay yours and the device becomes part of you, not a third presence in the room.

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Plaud Note (Market Leader)

| Dimension | Plaud | Amber |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Vibe | Cold, professional, utilitarian | Warm, personal, comforting |
| Form | Credit card, MagSafe attachment | Pendant jewelry, badge option |
| Market | Professional meetings | Life conversations |
| Aesthetic | Tech device | Comfort object |
| Emotional tone | Productivity | Peace of mind |

**Plaud owns professional meetings. Amber owns life conversations.**

### vs. Meta (Ray-Ban Glasses / Limitless acquisition)

| Dimension | Meta | Amber |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Privacy | Surveillance capitalism, data harvesting | File-first, your data yours |
| Form | Glasses (always visible, "glasshole" risk) | Pendant (discreet, can be hidden) |
| Ecosystem | Locked to Meta | Open files, any storage |
| Trust | Low (Meta reputation) | High (privacy-first architecture) |

**Meta is surveillance. Amber is security.**

### vs. Phone Recording

| Dimension | Phone | Amber |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Action | Pull out, unlock, find app, press record | Already wearing, already recording |
| Social signal | "I'm recording you" | "This matters to me" |
| Presence | Breaks eye contact, creates distance | Maintains full presence |
| Reliability | Might forget to start | Automatic when worn |

**Phone recording is awkward. Amber is invisible.**

## The Privacy Gap Opportunity

Meta acquired Limitless in December 2025 and killed the hardware, pushing users to Ray-Ban glasses. This creates a vacuum:

- Users who wanted a pendant (not glasses)
- Users who don't trust Meta with their data
- Users who want file-first, not cloud-first

Amber fills this gap as the **privacy-respecting alternative**.

## Positioning by Audience

### Medical/Caregivers
> "Never forget what the doctor said. Be present, not panicked."

### Professionals
> "The conversations that matter happen off the record. Now they don't have to."

### Universal
> "Never lose what matters. Wear it when it matters."
