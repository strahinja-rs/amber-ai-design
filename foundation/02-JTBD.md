# Jobs to Be Done

## Primary Job (Functional)

**When** I'm in a conversation that matters — a doctor's explanation, a professional discussion, an important personal exchange —

**I want to** preserve exactly what was said without disrupting my presence

**So I can** recall it accurately later and be fully present now.

---

## Emotional Job

**When** I'm in an anxious or high-stakes situation

**I want to** feel secure that nothing will be lost

**So I can** be present instead of frantically taking notes or worrying about forgetting.

---

## Social Job

**When** I wear Amber in front of others

**I want to** signal that this conversation is important to me

**So I can** be seen as someone who values what's being said (not as surveilling).

---

## Secondary Jobs

### The Recall Job
**When** I need to remember something from a past conversation

**I want to** query my preserved audio naturally

**So I can** retrieve exactly what was said without searching through recordings.

### The Context Job
**When** I'm about to meet someone I've met before

**I want to** recall what we discussed previously

**So I can** connect meaningfully without the awkwardness of forgetting.

### The Evidence Job
**When** something important was said (medical instructions, professional agreements)

**I want to** have an accurate record of the exact words

**So I can** refer back to what was actually said, not my imperfect memory of it.

## What People Are "Firing" to Hire Amber

| Current Solution | Why It Fails |
|------------------|--------------|
| Taking notes | Disrupts presence. Incomplete. Can't capture tone/nuance. |
| Phone recording | Awkward. Requires pulling out device. Feels surveillant. |
| Relying on memory | Unreliable. 40-80% of medical info forgotten immediately. |
| Asking others to remind you | Dependent. Embarrassing. Others forget too. |
| Meeting transcription software | Only works for scheduled calls. Misses hallway conversations. |

## The Moment of Hire

The decision to wear Amber happens when someone thinks:

> "I don't want to forget what's about to be said."

This is the trigger. Not "I need an AI assistant" — that's a different job entirely.
