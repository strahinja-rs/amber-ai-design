## The Core Insight

The privacy problem isn't about the device — it's about how it's framed.

Others made a mistake: they positioned the device as a separate entity — a companion, an AI friend, something with personality and agency. This creates a "third presence" in every interaction. That's why people rejected it. It's creepy.

## Our Belief

**The device is part of you, not separate from you.**

Like glasses help you see, Amber helps you remember. When you wear it, there aren't three presences in the room — there's just you, with better memory.

## What We Reject

- The "AI friend" paradigm
- Devices that reach out to you
- Always-on surveillance framing
- Personality, opinions, agency in tools
- Technology that tries to be human
- Video-first capture that you can't control or frame

## What We Embrace

- Tools as extensions of self
- Intentional use over passive capture
- Warmth without personality
- Honesty about what the device is
- Audio as the primary medium (conversations, voices, words)
- Peace of mind in anxious situations

## The Act of Wearing

Putting on Amber is a deliberate act. It means: "This conversation matters."

You don't wear Amber 24/7. You put it on intentionally — before a doctor's appointment, an important meeting, a conversation you don't want to forget. This transforms the device from surveillance to security.

## The Name

**Amber** — fossilized resin that preserves things perfectly.

- Voices, words, conversations trapped in time
- Already jewelry. Amber pendants exist. Belongs on a neck.
- Warm color — golden, honey, orange. Not cold, not tech.
- Translucent. Glows from within.
- A material, not an agent. Passive. No personality.

## The Line

> "Never lose what matters."

## Why Audio-First

A pendant can't be aimed like a camera. You have no viewfinder, no framing, no control over the visual.

But audio captures everything — the exact words, the tone, the pauses, the voice. Audio doesn't need framing. Audio is complete.

Amber is for **what was said**, not what was seen.

Audio is complete. No camera needed.

## Warmth as Security

The warm aesthetic isn't about visual nostalgia. It's about psychological comfort.

A doctor's appointment is stressful. A difficult conversation is anxious. Amber is your security blanket — warm, comforting, holding space for you. You can be fully present because Amber remembers for you.

The pendant is a **comfort object**, not a camera.

## Guiding Principle

It's not about making synthetic things organic. It's about keeping synthetic things synthetic — but making them warm, responsive, honest about what they are.

---

*"The neck holds what matters most — identity, memory, protection, connection."*

Amber is a pendant that preserves what was said. You wear it when it matters.
