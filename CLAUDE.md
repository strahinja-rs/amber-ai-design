# Amber - AI Design Hackathon

## Quick Context (Read This First)

**Product:** Amber — a wearable audio preservation device. "Never lose what matters."

**Core insight:** Audio-first. A pendant can't be aimed like a camera, but audio captures everything.

**Event:** 6-hour design hackathon | Feb 3, 2026 | 12:00-18:00 | Pencils down at 18:00

**Live Status:** See `STATUS.md` for current phase, time remaining, and progress.

## The Pivot

We started with "preserve moments" (visual + audio, nostalgic). We ended with:

**"Never forget what was said"** — audio-first, conversations, security/comfort.

Why: A pendant can't frame video. Audio captures everything. The value is in the words.

| Primary audience | Medical/Caregivers |
| Secondary audience | Professionals |
| Tertiary audience | Personal high-stakes conversations |
| Form factor | Pendant-first, badge option |
| Interaction | Wear = record. Radically simple. |
| Architecture | File-first (your files, your storage) |
| Warmth meaning | Comfort object, psychological security |
