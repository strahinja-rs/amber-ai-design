I'm designing Amber — an AI pendant for memory preservation. Key positioning: "Wear it when it matters." Intentional use, not 24/7. Not a companion or friend — a tool that's part of you, like glasses.

Deep analysis on these specific questions:

## 1. Professional Context Use Case
(meetings, negotiations, client relationships)
- What do professionals currently use to capture meeting context?
- What's the pain of forgetting names, faces, prior conversations?
- Would wearing a visible device be socially acceptable in professional settings?
- What's the ROI argument for such a device?

## 2. High-Stakes Medical Use Case
(patients/caregivers)
- Research on patient recall of medical consultations (what % is forgotten?)
- Legal/ethical considerations of recording medical appointments
- Existing solutions (recording apps, note-takers)
- Emotional weight of this use case

## 3. Memory Support Use Case
(early cognitive decline, ADHD)
- Is there stigma around assistive memory devices?
- What do people with ADHD currently use for context capture?
- Sensitivity considerations for marketing to this segment

## Output Requirements
- Provide confidence levels for each claim
- Note areas of uncertainty
- Cite sources where possible
