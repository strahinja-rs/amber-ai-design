# Gemini Deep Research Prompt: AI Wearable Market & Audience

Copy the text below into Gemini Deep Research:

---

The research goal is to understand the AI wearable market landscape and identify which audience segments have the most urgent need for a "memory preservation" device.

Context: We're designing "Amber" — an AI pendant positioned as "wear it when it matters." Unlike competitors (Friend, Humane Pin, Rabbit R1), Amber is NOT positioned as a companion or AI assistant. It's positioned as part of you — like glasses help you see, Amber helps you remember. Intentional use, not always-on.

I need to understand:

## 1. COMPETITOR ANALYSIS
- How did Humane Pin, Friend, Rabbit R1, Rewind, and other AI wearables position themselves?
- Why did some fail commercially or face backlash?
- What positioning is saturated (AI companion, assistant, friend)?
- What positioning is underserved?

## 2. AUDIENCE SEGMENTS
For "memory preservation" use cases (not AI assistant use cases), which segments have the MOST urgent need:
- Professionals (meetings, negotiations, client context)
- Healthcare situations (patients remembering diagnoses, caregivers)
- Parents (capturing childhood moments)
- Travelers/life-loggers
- People with memory conditions (early cognitive decline, ADHD)
- Students/learners

For each segment: pain points, current alternatives, willingness to pay, social acceptability of wearing such a device.

## 3. POSITIONING GAPS
- Is "intentional use" (wear it when it matters) a differentiator in this market?
- Has anyone positioned an AI wearable as a "tool" rather than "companion"?

## Output Requirements
- Structured report with headings
- Citations for key claims
- Flag conflicting information rather than averaging it
- Focus on 2024-2026 data
