# **Amber: Industrial Design Research Report on Ceramic Audio Preservation Wearables (2018–2026)**

## **Executive Summary**

The trajectory of wearable technology over the eight-year period from 2018 to 2026 reveals a decisive pivot from the "quantified self"—a regime dominated by wrist-worn biometric trackers and screen-centric efficiency tools—to the "qualified self," characterized by ambient, non-intrusive devices that seek to preserve the qualitative texture of human experience. This report, commissioned to inform the development of 'Amber', a ceramic wearable audio preservation pendant, synthesizes market precedents, material science, and design philosophies to define the emerging category of "Warm Tech."

The analysis indicates that the audio-preservation pendant serves a distinct sociological function: it acts as a "digital fossil," capturing the ephemeral nuances of conversation and memory that traditional screens and keyboards fail to record. Unlike the "lifelogging" cameras of the late 2010s, which struggled with social acceptance due to privacy concerns, the current generation of devices (2024–2026) prioritizes audio as a primary input, using visual sensors only as context-aware metadata generators.1 This shift necessitates a complete overhaul of the visual vocabulary of the device. The industrial design of such objects is moving away from the cold, hermetic aesthetics of aluminum and glass—synonymous with the "gadget"—toward materials that possess historical and tactile resonance, such as technical ceramics (Zirconia, Alumina) and bio-composites.2

A critical finding of this research is the tension between "smart" capabilities and "heirloom" aesthetics. Precedents like the Limitless Pendant and the Plaud NotePin demonstrate that while form factors are shrinking, the successful integration into a user’s identity requires a departure from the "black mirror" aesthetic. The most successful "warm tech" designs, championed by studios like LAYER, Morrama, and Map Project Office, utilize organic geometries, diffused lighting behaviors, and materials that mimic natural stone to create "comfort objects." These devices do not merely sit *on* the body; they interact with the wearer’s wardrobe and emotional state, acting as talismans of memory rather than tools of productivity.4

The following report provides an exhaustive examination of these dynamics. It dissects the failure and success of varied form factors, provides a deep technical review of ceramic manufacturing suited for RF-transparent wearables, and maps the design strategies that disguise high-tech sensors as benign, jewelry-like elements. Through this lens, 'Amber' is positioned not just as a recording device, but as a culturally integrated artifact of personal history.

## **Precedents: The Evolution of the Wearable Pendant (2018–2026)**

The history of the wearable pendant in this period is a history of friction—social, technical, and aesthetic. Early attempts to colonize the chest area with technology were often met with resistance, primarily because they prioritized technological novelty over social etiquette. However, as AI transcription and ambient computing matured between 2023 and 2026, the pendant found its *raison d'être* not as a camera for the world, but as a microphone for the self.

### **The Lifelogging Era and the Camera Stigma (2018–2022)**

Before the dominance of Large Language Models (LLMs) made audio summarization viable, the primary utility of pendant wearables was visual "lifelogging." Devices from this era provide crucial lessons in what *not* to do for a non-threatening integration.

The **Front Row** camera (circa 2018-2020) serves as a foundational archetype for the pendant form factor. Designed by Ubiquiti, it was a dedicated wearable camera that hung from a lanyard or chain, shaped like a stopwatch.6 While it offered a unique "first-person" perspective, its prominent, unblinking lens created significant social friction. It was unmistakably a camera, and its design language—glossy black plastic, circular lens centrality—placed it firmly in the "gadget" category. Users found it difficult to integrate into professional or intimate settings without signaling that they were "recording," which altered the behavior of those around them.6

Similarly, the **Google Clips** (discontinued early in this period) attempted to use AI to capture "candid" moments automatically. While it tried to be unobtrusive, its boxy, plastic aesthetic and the very nature of an autonomous camera staring at room occupants proved unsettling. The lesson for 'Amber' is clear: a "warm tech" device cannot lead with the lens. In the lifelogging era, the camera was the *hero*; in the preservation era, the camera must be the *ghost*—present for context, but invisible in character.

### **The Rise of the AI Audio Companion (2023–2026)**

The explosion of generative AI shifted the value proposition from "capturing video" to "understanding conversation." This enabled a new class of wearables where the primary interaction is passive audio capture, processed into actionable memories.

#### **The Limitless Pendant (2024–2026)**

The **Limitless Pendant** represents the most direct competitor and precedent for 'Amber'. Designed by **Ammunition Group**, the studio responsible for the Beats by Dre design language, the Limitless Pendant was explicitly crafted to overcome the "wearable stigma".7

* **Design & Form:** The device features a unique "clasp" form factor with a magnetic closure, allowing it to be worn on a necklace or clipped to a collar. Ammunition focused on a "refined and intelligent" aesthetic, utilizing matte and iridescent finishes that break away from the standard consumer electronics palette of black and silver.7  
* **Materiality:** While largely constructed of lightweight polymers and aluminum to maintain a low weight for all-day wear, the finish targets a "soft" appearance. It avoids the cold touch of raw metal, leaning towards textures that feel consistent with clothing accessories.  
* **Interaction Model:** The interaction is minimal—passive recording with a "Trust Light" LED that indicates status. This LED is a critical design element; it is designed to be visible enough to assuage privacy concerns of interlocutors but diffused enough to not distract.7  
* **Fate & Insight:** By late 2025, Limitless was acquired by Meta, and the standalone device sales ceased.8 This consolidation suggests that while the form factor was valid, the standalone hardware model is difficult to sustain without a massive ecosystem. For 'Amber', this implies that the physical object must have intrinsic value (like jewelry) beyond its electronic utility to justify its existence as a standalone artifact.

#### **The Plaud NotePin (2024–2026)**

While Limitless targeted the "prosumer" and lifestyle market, the **Plaud NotePin** focused aggressively on the professional utility of transcription.

* **Form Factor:** The NotePin is an ultra-light (0.59 oz), pill-shaped device constructed from aluminum alloy and polycarbonate.9 Its defining feature is versatility; it can be worn as a magnetic pin, a clip, a wristband, or a pendant.  
* **Aesthetic:** The design is unapologetically utilitarian but sleek, available in "Cosmic Gray," "Lunar Silver," and "Sunset Purple." The purple variant attempts to bridge the gap to fashion, but the device largely retains a "business tool" visual vocabulary.9  
* **Camera Integration:** Notably, the NotePin *lacks* a camera, relying entirely on dual MEMS microphones for high-fidelity audio.10 This omission simplifies social acceptance—no one fears being filmed by a NotePin—but it limits the "preservation" aspect to audio only.  
* **Insight for Amber:** The NotePin’s success in the professional market highlights the demand for "set and forget" recording. However, its utilitarian aesthetic limits its emotional resonance. 'Amber' can differentiate itself by offering the *emotional* weight that the NotePin lacks, using ceramics to create a device that feels permanent rather than disposable.

#### **The "Friend" Necklace (2025)**

The **Friend** necklace serves as a polarized case study in the "AI Companion" sub-category. Launched with a focus on combating loneliness through an always-listening AI, its design and reception offer a stark warning.11

* **Design:** A 2-inch plastic disc resembling a "chunky AirTag" or a "microphone on a shoelace".12 The material choice (plastic) and the form factor (simple white disc) conveyed a sense of cheapness and surveillance rather than warmth.  
* **Social Friction:** The device faced immediate backlash. Users were accused of "wearing a wire," and the device’s "personality"—which could be snarky or critical—alienated users.12  
* **Insight for Amber:** The failure of "Friend" was partly aesthetic. It *looked* like a surveillance bug. A ceramic, textured, or sculpted form (as proposed for 'Amber') serves a functional purpose: it signals "jewelry" or "art," thereby disarming the "surveillance" suspicion that a plain white plastic disc triggers.

### **Specialized Archetypes: Health and Safety Pendants**

Beyond general-purpose AI, the health and safety sector has pioneered the "pendant" form factor for decades. The 2018–2026 period saw these devices evolve from "medical beige" buttons to sophisticated wearables.

#### **Totem Compass (2024–2026)**

The **Totem Compass** is a festival-centric wearable designed to help friends find each other without cell service.14

* **Visual Vocabulary:** It uses a "language of light." A ring of LEDs (the "Halo") provides directional cues. The casing is made of MABS plastic but features "skins" and custom necklaces, moving it toward fashion.14  
* **Warm Tech implementation:** The interface is entirely ambient. There are no screens or text; only color and light patterns (e.g., "Vibe Mode" which reacts to music).14 This abstraction of data into light is a powerful "warm tech" principle: data should be felt or sensed, not just read.  
* **Relevance:** The Totem Compass proves that users are willing to wear a pendant prominently if it enables connection and looks "cool" (festival aesthetic). 'Amber' can adopt similar light-based feedback mechanisms (e.g., a soft pulse when recording meaningful audio) to create a bond with the user.

#### **MemPal (MIT Media Lab Prototype, 2025\)**

Perhaps the most technically relevant precedent for 'Amber' is the **MemPal** system from the MIT Media Lab.1

* **Function:** A memory assistant for older adults that logs daily activities to help find misplaced objects ("Where are my keys?").  
* **Camera Integration Strategy:** MemPal uses a wearable camera for *visual context*, but explicitly **does not store image data**. The images are processed in real-time to generate text logs (e.g., "User put keys on the counter") and then discarded.1  
* **Design Aesthetic:** While a prototype, its philosophy is groundbreaking. It positions the camera as a "private eye" that serves the user, not a "public eye" that broadcasts to the world.  
* **Insight for Amber:** This "Privacy-by-Design" architecture is the key to non-threatening camera integration. 'Amber' should market its camera not as a video recorder, but as a "Context Sensor" that helps the AI understand *who* is speaking and *where* the conversation is happening, without keeping the video file.

### **Summary of Precedents**

| Device | Era | Material | Key Feature | Relevance to Amber |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Front Row** | 2018-2020 | Plastic/Glass | Dedicated Social Camera | **Negative Precedent:** "Eye" aesthetic creates social friction. |
| **Limitless Pendant** | 2024-2025 | Aluminum/Polymer | Magnetic Clasp, Audio AI | **Positive Precedent:** Form factor, unobtrusive LED usage. |
| **Plaud NotePin** | 2024-2026 | Aluminum Alloy | Versatile Clip/Pin | **Functional Precedent:** Professional utility, but lacks emotional warmth. |

| **Totem Compass** | 2024-2026 | MABS/Plastic | Light-based UI | **Aesthetic Precedent:** Ambient communication via light. |
| **MemPal** | 2025 | Prototype | Context Camera | **Technical Precedent:** Camera for context only, privacy preservation. |

## **Materials: Technical Ceramics and the Chemistry of Warmth**

For 'Amber', the selection of ceramic material is the single most critical industrial design decision. It dictates the tactile experience (the "hand-feel"), the perceived value (weight and temperature), and the technical performance (RF transparency for cloud syncing and thermal management for AI processing).

### **Zirconia (![][image1]): The Jewelry Standard**

**Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ)** is currently the premier material for high-end wearables, utilized by brands like Oura (Ring 4), Rado, and Omega.16

* **Properties:** Zirconia offers extreme fracture toughness (it is often called "ceramic steel") and high hardness (approx. 1200 HV). Unlike metals, it is hypoallergenic and biocompatible, making it safe for long-term contact with the skin in the chest area, which can be sensitive to nickel or other alloys.18  
* **Aesthetics:** Zirconia can be sintered to a high density, giving it a luxurious "heft" that plastics lack. It supports a wide range of colors—from deep, piano blacks to translucent milky whites—and can be polished to a mirror finish or sandblasted for a matte, stone-like texture.20  
* **Thermal Tactility:** One of the defining features of "warm tech" is thermal effusivity. Ceramics like Zirconia have lower thermal conductivity than aluminum, meaning they do not feel shockingly cold to the touch in winter, nor do they heat up as rapidly as metal when the device processor is active.3

### **Alumina (![][image2]) and ZTA: Thermal Management Solutions**

While Zirconia is aesthetically superior, **Alumina** is functionally critical for devices with powerful onboard processing (like AI audio transcription).

* **Thermal Management:** Alumina has significantly higher thermal conductivity (![][image3]) compared to Zirconia (![][image4]).3 For 'Amber', an Alumina backplate (the part touching the user or the heat sink) could effectively dissipate heat generated by the battery and processor, preventing the "hot spot" issue that plagued the Humane AI Pin.23  
* **Zirconia Toughened Alumina (ZTA):** A composite material that disperses Zirconia particles within an Alumina matrix.24 This hybrid offers the "best of both worlds": the wear resistance and thermal properties of Alumina with the toughness of Zirconia. ZTA is increasingly used in medical implants and high-stress industrial components, offering a narrative of "durability" and "permanence" for a preservation device.25

### **Ceralun and Jewelry Integration**

To move 'Amber' further into the realm of jewelry, **Ceralun** represents a unique material opportunity. Developed by Swarovski, Ceralun is a two-part ceramic epoxy composite designed specifically for setting crystals and creating complex, free-form shapes.26

* **Application:** Unlike sintered ceramics which require molds and high-temperature firing, Ceralun functions like a clay that cures to a ceramic-like hardness. This allows for embedding other materials—such as a sapphire glass camera cover, gold accents, or haptic actuators—seamlessly into the pendant body without the need for bezels or adhesives that break the visual continuity.26  
* **Texture:** Ceralun allows for "stamping" textures during the curing process, enabling the creation of surfaces that mimic leather, wood grain, or fossilized coral, reinforcing the "organic" visual vocabulary.26

### **Bio-Ceramics and RF Transparency**

Wearables that rely on cloud connectivity (Wi-Fi, LTE, Bluetooth) face challenges with metal casings, which block RF signals. Ceramics are inherently **RF transparent** (dielectric), allowing antennas to be placed internally without external plastic "break lines" or antenna bands.28

* **Hydroxyapatite:** A bio-active ceramic used in bone implants. While currently rare in consumer electronics, using a bio-ceramic coating on the back of the pendant could market the device as being "in harmony" with the body, chemically similar to human bone.19 This narrative powerfully supports the "Comfort Object" positioning.

### **Material Recommendations for Amber**

1. **Chassis:** **Yttria-Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ)** for the main visible housing. Finish: Satin/Matte to mimic river stone. Color: "Bone" or "Deep Amber" (translucent).  
2. **Thermal Interface:** **Alumina** or **ZTA** backplate for heat dissipation against the clothing (not skin) to keep the device cool during processing.  
3. **Sensor Integration:** **Ceralun** composite to seamlessly bond the camera lens and microphone ports, eliminating mechanical seams and creating a "monolithic" artifact.

## **Designers and Studios: Architects of Warm Tech**

The "Warm Tech" aesthetic is not accidental; it is the result of specific design philosophies cultivated by leading industrial design studios. Understanding their work provides a roadmap for 'Amber'.

### **LAYER (Benjamin Hubert)**

**Benjamin Hubert** and his studio **LAYER** are the vanguard of "experience-driven" design that prioritizes human emotion over technical specification.30

* **Philosophy:** Hubert coined the term "change" in the context of wearables, suggesting devices should evolve with the user. His work emphasizes "soft" interactions and materials that age gracefully.31  
* **Key Project: PiA:** A suite of devices including a wearable camera module. The design takes inspiration from nature, using tactile materials like recycled glass and jewelry-like finishes. The camera is treated not as a lens but as a "gem" or an integrated part of the sculptural form.32  
* **Key Project: Balance of Being:** A collaboration with Panasonic featuring devices like "Tone," a neck-worn skin treatment device. The aesthetic is purely *wabi-sabi*—celebrating organic imperfection, muted tones, and soft curves that look like ceramics or smooth pebbles.33

### **Morrama**

**Morrama**, led by Jo Barnard, focuses on "Tech as Expression." They argue that for wearables to go mainstream, they must blend with fashion and allow for personal expression.34

* **Key Project: Issé:** A smart glasses concept with interchangeable frames, acknowledging that style is fluid. This suggests 'Amber' could benefit from modularity—perhaps a ceramic core that fits into different metal or leather carriers.34  
* **Key Project: Future Skincare:** Conceptual devices like "The Patch" utilize temperature-changing mechanisms and antimicrobial copper/ceramic materials. The forms are fluid, skin-like, and devoid of sharp "tech" edges, aiming to soothe rather than alert.35

### **Map Project Office**

**Map Project Office** excels at bridging the physical and digital worlds through "strategic craft".36

* **Key Project: Little Signals (with Google):** This project is the ultimate reference for "non-threatening" interaction. It uses "calm" notifications—a puff of air, a shadow, a subtle movement—instead of beeps or vibrations.37 For 'Amber', this implies using light (like the Totem Compass) or gentle warmth to signal recording, rather than an aggressive red LED.  
* **Key Project: Sonic Heirloom:** A project exploring how to encode memory through sound.37 This is conceptually identical to 'Amber'. The design language involves objects that look like artifacts—vessels, stones, plates—that "hold" sound, reinforcing the idea of the pendant as a "container" for memory.

### **Ammunition Group**

**Ammunition Group** (Robert Brunner) brought the **Limitless Pendant** to life. Their contribution to "warm tech" is the refinement of the *mechanism*.

* **Design Language:** They focus on the "disappearing" interface. The Limitless Pendant is sleek, with a magnetic clasp that makes the mechanics of wearing it invisible. The use of iridescence and matte finishes attempts to dematerialize the "plastic" feel of the device.7

## **Visual Vocabulary: Distinguishing Comfort Objects from Gadgets**

To successfully position 'Amber' as a comfort object, the industrial design must consciously reject the semiotics of the gadget.

| Feature | The Gadget Aesthetic | The Comfort Object (Warm Tech) Aesthetic |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Form** | Geometric, extruded, chamfered edges, symmetry. | Organic, pebble-like, asymmetrical, fluid transitions.38 |
| **Material** | Anodized aluminum, clear glass, glossy plastic. | Unnglazed ceramic, matte Zirconia, Ceralun, fabric, wood.2 |
| **Camera** | "Cyclops" lens, black pupil, reflective glass, prominent bezel. | "Hidden" aperture, micro-perforated ceramic, tinted sapphire, integrated into texture.40 |
| **Lighting** | Sharp, pixelated LEDs (Red/Green/Blue). | Diffused glow, sub-surface scattering, "breathing" pulse, warm color temperatures.14 |
| **Touch** | Cold, hard, slick. | Warm, textured (stone/paper feel), grippy, soft-touch coatings.42 |
| **Interaction** | Screens, buttons with "click" feedback. | Capacitive surfaces, squeeze gestures, weight, haptic "thump" (heartbeat).43 |

### **Non-Threatening Camera Integration Techniques**

1. **The "Smoked" Lens:** Instead of a clear glass cover, use a specialized tinted sapphire that matches the ceramic body color (e.g., deep amber or black). The camera sensor can see through it, but the human eye cannot see the lens mechanism, making the surface appear continuous.  
2. **Texture Camouflage:** Integrating the camera aperture into a surface texture, such as the "crackle" of a ceramic glaze or the pores of a stone finish. The lens becomes just another "imperfection" in the material.40  
3. **The "Context Sensor" Framing:** Visually grouping the camera with other non-visual sensors (like IR or ToF sensors) behind a unified, matte-finish window. This signals "sensor array" rather than "video camera," shifting the perception from surveillance to sensing.

### **The "Heirloom" Semiotic**

Comfort objects imply longevity. Gadgets imply obsolescence. 'Amber' should utilize design cues from jewelry history:

* **Bezel Settings:** Even if functional, setting the ceramic core into a metal rim (gold/brass) evokes the language of a locket or cameo.44  
* **Weight:** Leveraging the high density of Zirconia to give the pendant a "precious" weight, mimicking a stone talisman rather than a hollow plastic shell.

## **Midjourney Prompts: Visualizing 'Amber'**

These prompts are calibrated to generate industrial design concepts that embody the "Warm Tech" and ceramic aesthetic, prioritizing the visual vocabulary defined above.

### **Prompt 1: The "River Stone" Archetype**

**Prompt:** Industrial design photography of a wearable audio pendant named 'Amber'. The device is shaped like a smooth, asymmetrical river stone made of matte bisque porcelain. The material has a subtle, earthy texture. There is no visible camera lens; instead, a tiny, micro-perforated aperture is integrated into the ceramic surface. A soft, warm amber light glows diffusely from within the ceramic body, suggesting a heartbeat. The pendant hangs from a braided raw silk cord. Macro shot, shallow depth of field, natural morning light, soft shadows. Designed by Benjamin Hubert LAYER, wabi-sabi aesthetic, tech-minimalism, heirloom quality. \--ar 4:5 \--v 6.0

### **Prompt 2: The "Fossilized Sound" Concept**

**Prompt:** A conceptual wearable device, 'Amber', designed as a jewelry artifact. The body is translucent, amber-colored Zirconia ceramic with a cloudy, crystalline internal structure. It looks like a piece of sea glass or a fossil. Embedded within is a vague, dark sensor array that is barely visible, non-threatening. The device rests on a piece of weathered driftwood. Warm color palette, rich textures, tactile material. No screens, no buttons. Cinematic lighting, photorealistic, 8k resolution. Style of Morrama and Ammunition Group. \--ar 16:9 \--stylize 250

### **Prompt 3: The "Ceramic & Tech" Hybrid**

**Prompt:** Close-up detail shot of a high-tech ceramic pendant. The material is 'Cosmic Black' Zirconia with a satin finish. The camera integration is hidden behind a tinted sapphire window that blends seamlessly with the body. A thin rim of rose gold surrounds the device. A subtle LED indicator acts as a privacy light, glowing with a soft, diffused white light. The aesthetic is 'Soft Tech' – blending high fashion jewelry with advanced AI hardware. Clean, sophisticated, luxury product photography. \--ar 3:2 \--v 6.0

### **Prompt 4: The "Contextual" Lifestyle Scene**

**Prompt:** A lifestyle photograph of a creative professional wearing a ceramic smart pendant. The pendant is a soft grey ceramic square with rounded corners, clipped to a linen jacket. It looks like a modern brooch, not a gadget. The wearer is in a sunlit studio filled with plants. The device is unobtrusive, blending into the fabric. Soft focus, lifestyle photography, warm atmosphere. The pendant has a subtle tactile surface texture like unglazed clay. \--ar 2:3

## **Conclusion**

The market data from 2018 to 2026 confirms that the era of the aggressive, camera-forward wearable is over. It has been replaced by an era of **ambient intimacy**, where technology is expected to respect the social fabric of daily life. For 'Amber' to succeed, it must navigate the "Uncanny Valley" of wearables: it must be smart enough to be useful, but "dumb" enough in appearance to be trusted.

By adopting **Zirconia** or **ZTA** ceramics, 'Amber' can achieve a tactile warmth and physical permanence that plastic competitors lack. By following the design cues of **LAYER** and **Map Project Office**, it can adopt a visual language of "soft signals" and "heirloom forms." And by utilizing a **privacy-first camera architecture**—inspired by MemPal—it can offer the utility of visual context without the stigma of surveillance. The ultimate goal is to create a device that feels less like a recorder of the present, and more like a fossil of the future.
