# Gemini Deep Research: Industrial Design Precedents

## Prompt

<context>
I am an industrial designer working on a wearable audio preservation device called Amber — a pendant-form-factor device that captures conversations. The design philosophy is "warm tech" — a comfort object that feels like jewelry, not surveillance equipment.

Current design direction: cream/honey ceramic body, minimal gold accents, ~40mm diameter pendant. Key challenge: integrating a small camera (for context, not primary capture) without triggering "surveillance device" associations.
</context>

<scope>
- Time period: 2018-2026 (focus on 2022-2026)
- Categories: ONLY pendant-worn and badge/brooch-worn tech devices
- Exclude: smartwatches, smart rings, earbuds, fitness bands, VR/AR headsets
- Include adjacent: hearing aids with pendant components, medical alert pendants, smart jewelry, wearable cameras that succeeded in feeling non-threatening
</scope>

<goal>
I need to identify specific products, designers, and design languages that achieved "warm" or "human-centered" aesthetics in wearable tech pendants/badges.

Key questions:
1. Which pendant/badge wearables have successfully integrated cameras without looking like surveillance devices? What specific design choices made them feel safe?
2. What ceramic or ceramic-like materials have been used in premium wearable tech? (Brand names, material specifications, finish types)
3. Which industrial designers or design studios are known for "warm tech" or "humanized technology" aesthetics?
4. What are the specific visual vocabularies (shapes, proportions, edge treatments, material combinations) that distinguish "comfort object" from "gadget"?
5. How have successful wearable pendants handled status indicators (LEDs, subtle signals) without looking like blinking tech?
</goal>

<output>
Structure the report as:

1. **Executive Summary** (200 words): Key patterns found

2. **Camera Integration Precedents**: Products that integrated cameras in wearables without surveillance feeling. For each: product name, designer/company, specific design choices that worked, high-quality image search terms

3. **Warm Materials Catalog**: Ceramic and ceramic-adjacent materials used in wearables. Include: material trade names, finish types (matte, satin, glazed), color terminology used by manufacturers, brands that used them

4. **Designer/Studio Profiles**: 5-8 designers or studios known for humanized tech. For each: name, notable projects, signature aesthetic elements, keywords associated with their style

5. **Visual Vocabulary Table**:
| Element | "Gadget" Treatment | "Comfort Object" Treatment |
| Shape | ... | ... |
| Edges | ... | ... |
| Proportions | ... | ... |
| Materials | ... | ... |
| Indicators | ... | ... |

6. **Midjourney-Friendly Terminology**: Specific phrases, material names, designer names, and style references that will help image generation tools understand "warm wearable tech"

7. **Source List**: Dezeen, Core77, Yanko Design, design award databases, product pages
</output>

<criteria>
Source quality requirements:
- Prioritize: Design publications (Dezeen, Core77, Yanko Design, Wallpaper*, Designboom), design award databases (Red Dot, iF Design, IDEA), official product pages
- Avoid: Amazon listings, generic tech blogs, SEO content farms
- For each product mentioned: include designer/company name and year

Citation requirements:
- Provide URLs for all products mentioned
- Include image gallery URLs where available
</criteria>

<constraints>
- Do not include smartwatches, rings, or earbuds regardless of how "warm" they look
- Do not speculate — if you can't find a specific example, say so
- Focus on products that actually shipped or won awards, not concept renders
- When describing visual qualities, use concrete terminology (e.g., "3mm radius corners" not "rounded")
</constraints>
