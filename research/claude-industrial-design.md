# Claude Research: Industrial Design Precedents

## Prompt

Claude, please use the Research tool to investigate industrial design precedents for warm, human-centered wearable technology in pendant and badge form factors.

<context>
I'm designing Amber — a wearable audio preservation pendant. Design philosophy: "warm tech" — feels like a comfort object, not surveillance. Key challenge: integrating a small camera without triggering threat responses.

Current aesthetic: cream/honey ceramic, gold accents, ~40mm pendant. Issues with current Midjourney results: "ceramic" renders as cold white, "amber" triggers literal gemstones, gold rims look like lockets, cameras look surveillance-y.
</context>

<task>
Find specific, named examples of pendant/badge wearables that achieved warmth, humanity, or "comfort object" feeling. I need concrete references — product names, designer names, material specifications — that I can use as a foundation for design direction and image generation prompts.
</task>

<key_questions>
1. **Camera Integration**: Which wearable pendants/badges integrated cameras successfully without surveillance aesthetics? What specific design choices defused the "creepy" factor? (Lens placement, size, framing, surrounding materials)

2. **Warm Ceramics**: What specific ceramic materials, finishes, and colors have been used in premium wearables or jewelry-tech? Include trade names, manufacturer terminology, finish specifications (matte vs satin vs gloss gradations)

3. **Indicator Design**: How have pendant wearables handled status LEDs, notifications, or feedback without looking like blinking gadgets? Any examples of "breathing" lights, edge-lit effects, or material-integrated indicators?

4. **Designer References**: Which industrial designers or studios have a signature style of humanized/warm technology? Names I can reference in image prompts.

5. **Shape Language**: What geometric vocabulary distinguishes "organic tech" from "gadget"? Specific proportions, edge radii, thickness ratios that read as warm vs clinical.
</key_questions>

<source_requirements>
Priority hierarchy:
1. Design publications: Dezeen, Core77, Yanko Design, Wallpaper*, Designboom
2. Design award databases: Red Dot, iF Design Award, IDEA Awards
3. Official product pages and press releases
4. Designer portfolio sites

Avoid: Amazon reviews, generic tech blogs, undated content, SEO aggregators
</source_requirements>

<output_format>
1. **Executive Summary**: 5 key findings for warm pendant design

2. **Product Case Studies** (most important section):
   For each relevant product found:
   - Name, company, designer (if known), year
   - Why it's relevant (camera? ceramic? warm aesthetic?)
   - Specific design choices that worked
   - Image search terms that would find this product
   - URL

3. **Materials Glossary**:
   Ceramic and warm material terminology with examples of use

4. **Designer Reference List**:
   Names + signature aesthetic descriptors

5. **Visual Language Guide**:
   Concrete shape/proportion/finish choices that code as "warm"

6. **Terminology for Image Generation**:
   Specific phrases, style references, and material names optimized for Midjourney/image AI

7. **Confidence Assessment**:
   - High confidence findings (multiple sources)
   - Medium confidence (single strong source)
   - Gaps where research found little
</output_format>

<constraints>
- Pendant and badge wearables ONLY — no watches, rings, earbuds, bands
- Shipped products or award-winning concepts only — no random Pinterest renders
- Concrete specifics over general principles — I need names, not just "use organic shapes"
- If you can't find examples for something, say so explicitly
</constraints>

## Tips

- If Claude asks clarifying questions, answer thoroughly
- Watch for verbosity as uncertainty signal
- Verify any product names against real sources afterward
