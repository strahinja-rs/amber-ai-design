Initial concept

My initial idea is oriented around this core insight:

The privacy problem isn't about the device — it's about how it's framed.

The mistake others made (Friend, etc.): Positioned the device as a separate entity — a companion, an AI friend, something with personality and agency. This creates a "third presence" in every interaction. Creepy. People rejected it.

Our reframe: The device is part of you, not separate from you. Like glasses help you see, this helps you remember. When you wear it, there aren't three presences in the room — there's just you, with better memory.

The Name: Amber

Why amber:

Amber is fossilized resin that preserves things perfectly — insects, leaves, moments trapped in time
Already jewelry. Amber pendants exist. Belongs on a neck.
Warm color — golden, honey, orange. Not cold, not tech.
Translucent. Glows from within. Can indicate it's always on status. 

"Trapped in amber" is already a phrase for perfectly preserved memory (not sure about this though). 

It's a material, not an agent. Passive. No personality.

The line:

"Everything I get in touch with gets preserved."

Key Positioning: Wear it when it matters.

You don't wear Amber 24/7. You put it on intentionally — like a camera. This is the most important thing. Put it on when it matters. 

Situations where this matters:

Doctor explaining diagnosis, treatment options
Client meetings, negotiations
Conferences, workshops, learning moments
Travel — places, people, stories
Deep conversations you want to hold onto
Networking — names, faces, context
Kid's childhood moments
Any situation where you think "I want to remember this"

Putting it on is a deliberate act. "This matters."

Language:
Don't say: Recording, Capturing, Storing, Footage
Say: Preserving, Keeping, Held, Moments

Design Principles
Physical form:

Warm glow from within — amber tones, golden, honey
Translucent, not transparent
Camera lens is subtle, embedded, part of the surface — not an obvious eye
Feels like jewelry, not gadget
Honest about being a device (no disguise), but warm

Interaction:

No personality. No name. No voice. No opinions.
It never reaches out to you. You reach into it.
No proactive notifications (or minimal, user-defined)
You query your memory. It returns results. That's it.

Guiding concept (from Apple's Liquid Glass):

It's not about making synthetic things organic. It's about keeping synthetic things synthetic — but making them warm, responsive, honest about what they are.

What Amber Is NOT: 

Not a friend
Not a companion
Not an AI assistant with personality
Not surveillance
Not always-worn (you choose when)
Not trying to be human

Tagline Directions:

"Wear it when it matters."
"Keep what you touch."
"Moments, preserved."
"Nothing fades."
"Remember better."

Remember

"The neck holds what matters most — identity, memory, protection, connection."

Amber is a pendant that preserves. You wear it when it matters. Everything you get in touch with gets preserved. There is sacredness to Amber.
