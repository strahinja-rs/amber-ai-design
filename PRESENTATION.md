# Amber — Presentation Outline

## Opening Hook

**Start with the stat:**
> "40-80% of medical information is forgotten immediately after leaving the doctor's office."

**The broader problem:**
Conversations that matter — diagnoses, negotiations, deep personal moments — get lost. We remember the feeling, but not the words.

**Current solutions fail:**
- Phone recording = awkward, breaks eye contact, signals distrust
- Note-taking = splits attention, incomplete
- Memory = unreliable when stressed

---

## The Insight

**The privacy problem with AI wearables isn't the device — it's the framing.**

Humane Pin, Friend, Rabbit R1 — they all positioned themselves as companions, assistants, friends. A separate entity. A "third presence" in your conversations.

That's creepy.

**The reframe:**
What if the device wasn't separate from you? What if it was *part* of you — like glasses help you see, this helps you remember?

No personality. No opinions. No reaching out. Just you, with better memory.

## Introducing Amber

**"Never lose what matters."**

Amber is a wearable pendant that preserves conversations so you can be fully present.

**How it works:**
- **Wear** → Recording starts automatically
- **Remove** → Recording stops
- **Search** → "What did Dr. Chen say about the medication?"

**Audio-first philosophy:**
A pendant can't be aimed like a camera. You have no viewfinder. But audio captures everything — the exact words, the tone, the pauses.

No camera. Audio is complete.

Research validated this: cameras trigger surveillance response regardless of aesthetics. Friend's redesign removed their camera and won iF Design Award 2025. Plaud Note proves audio-only works.

## Who Needs This Most?

**Ranked by urgency of "never forget what was said":**

| Segment | Urgency | Why |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Medical/Caregivers | Highest | 40-80% forgotten, health consequences |
| Professionals | High | Deals lost, context missing |
| Personal | Medium | Meaningful but lower frequency |

**Primary audience: Medical/Caregivers**
- 53M family caregivers in US
- HIPAA doesn't restrict patient recording
- 39 states are one-party consent
- Highest stakes, clearest pain point

**Secondary: Professionals**
- Hallway conversations, networking, client dinners
- "Meeting software captures scheduled calls. Amber captures the rest."

---

## Market Validation

**Plaud Note: $10M+ in sales**
- Audio-only recorder
- Utilitarian, cold, professional
- Proves the market exists

**Meta acquired Limitless (Dec 2025)**
- Killed the hardware
- Pushed users to Ray-Ban glasses
- Created a privacy gap

**The opportunity:**
- Users who wanted a pendant (not glasses)
- Users who don't trust Meta with their data
- Users who want file-first, not cloud-first

## File-First Architecture

**Inspired by Obsidian — your data is yours.**

```
AMBER DEVICE
  → Audio recording → Local storage (64GB)
  → On-device transcription, speaker diarization
        ↓
YOUR CHOSEN STORAGE
  → iCloud Drive / Google Drive / Dropbox
  → Or Amber Sync (zero-knowledge encrypted)
        ↓
AMBER APP (renderer only)
  → Reads your files
  → Provides search, timeline, queries
  → Delete the app? Your files still exist.
```

**No vendor lock-in. If Amber disappears, your files remain.**

## Brand

**Warmth = Security** (not nostalgia)

The pendant is a comfort object for anxious situations. Wearing it means peace of mind — you won't forget.

**Personality:**
- Warm — not cold tech
- Quiet — no personality, no voice
- Honest — doesn't disguise what it is
- Secure — peace of mind
- Timeless — like amber itself

**Visual:**
- Colors: Amber gold (#D4A253), warm brown, soft cream, rich black
- Typography: Fraunces (display), Source Serif (body), Plus Jakarta (UI)
- No blue, no purple, no AI clichés

## Industrial Design

**Form:** Asymmetric pebble (~38mm × 46mm)
- Not a perfect circle — organic, like a river stone or seed
- C2 curvature continuity (no visible "break lines")

**Material:** Yttria-stabilized zirconia ceramic
- Satin glazed finish — warm to touch, not clinical
- Kaolin-inspired warm cream color

**Trust Light:** Edge glow through translucent ceramic
- Warm amber glow when preserving
- Material IS the diffuser — glow comes from within
- "The device warms when it's listening"

**Mics:** 3-mic array integrated into ceramic texture
- "Texture camouflage" — no visible pinhole array

**No camera.** Research showed cameras trigger surveillance response.

**Design philosophy:**
- Fukasawa "Without Thought" — dissolves into behavior
- Morrison "Super Normal" — quiet sophistication
- Inspired by Oura Ring ceramic aesthetic
